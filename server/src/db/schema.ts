/**
 * Canonical Drizzle schema — EVERY table in the schema.
 *
 * Tenancy rule: every domain table carries `workspace_id` (FK→workspaces)
 * and, where relevant, `created_by` (FK→users). All queries scope by
 * workspace_id via the base-repository guard.
 *
 * This is the COMPLETE schema. Feature agents A1–A6 do NOT run parallel
 * migrations against these tables — they only extend with their own new
 * columns/tables via their own migrations.
 *
 * The tables are organized into domain files under `./schema/`; this barrel
 * re-exports them so every consumer keeps importing from `db/schema` unchanged.
