// This skill's job is to analyze real files (package.json, tsconfig.json, node_modules sizes),
// but "quality" cases run with no tools (skillTask measures the SKILL.md content in isolation —
// see tasks.ts). So each prompt inlines a small synthetic dataset the skill can reason over
// directly, standing in for what the skill would normally gather itself with Read/Bash/Grep.

const REPO_DATA = `Here is the data you'd normally gather yourself — treat it as already collected, and produce the report directly from it (do not ask for tool access or more data).

Installed sizes (du -sh):
server/node_modules/moment: 4.2M
server/node_modules/drizzle-orm: 8.1M
server/node_modules/fastify: 6.5M
server/node_modules/pg: 3.8M

server/package.json also declares zod@3.23.8, client/package.json declares zod@3.22.4, reviewer-core/package.json declares zod@3.23.8 — three different resolved zod versions across packages.

grep for imports crossing package boundaries:
- server/src/routes/reviews.ts imports types from "@shared/review-types" (alias to server/src/vendor/shared)
- server/src/services/review-service.ts imports "reviewer-core/src/pipeline.js" directly by relative path (not via the package's public entry point)
- client/src/lib/api-types.ts imports "@shared/review-types" (same alias as server)
- grep found no import of "moment" anywhere under server/src — only present in package.json`;
